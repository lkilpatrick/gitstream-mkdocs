# Context variables

gitStream includes a collection of variables called contexts. 

- [`branch`](#branch-context)
- [`files`](#files-context)
- [`source`](#source-context)
- [`repo`](#repo-context)

The following structures definitions:

- [`FileMetadata`](#filemetadata-structure)
- [`FileDiff`](#filediff-structure)
- [`Contributor`](#contributor-structure)

#### `branch` context

The `branch` context contains info regarding the branch changes compared to the base branch. 

!!! note  

    compared to the `source` context does not include actual source code.

|---------|-----------|------------------------ |
| `files` | [String]  | List of all changed files with their full path |

#### `source` context

| `source`          | Map   | Info related to source code           |
| `source.diff`     | [Map] | Includes the info compared to the default branch, `main` |
| `source.diff.files` | [`FileDiff`] | List of changed files with their code changes |

The source context include all code changes, it is not safe to share it with unknown services.

#### `FileDiff` structure

The `source.diff.files` mapping includes a list of `FileDiff`:
